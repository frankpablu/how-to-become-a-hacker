# Hacking skills

## Fundamentals
First of all, how do you hack something you don't understand? After this question is evident, you have to know the fundamentals of IT, but how?

I will suggest this courses to learn the basics of IT:
1. Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (the expensive one)
2. Certificates like CompTIA A+ [[3]](#3-httpswwwcomptiaorgcertificationsa) (medium cost)
3. Courses (the cheapest one) like:
-Google IT Support Professional Certificate [[4]](#4-httpswwwcourseraorgprofessional-certificatesgoogle-it-support)

No matter how you learn that, you don't have to gain the "certificate" but knowledge

## Basic Networking Skills
This skill it's like the "backbone" of hacking, you can learn this skill in courses like:
1. Professor Messer Free Network+ Course [[5]](#5-httpsyoutubeas6g6ixcva4)

## Linux Skills

It's no secret that this is one of the most important skills for a hacker, so here are some resources to learn it, although to be honest, I don't recommend you to do a certification, you can learn all this by downloading ubuntu and getting curious.

But if you want a course for the basics, I recommend these resources:

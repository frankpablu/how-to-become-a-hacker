# Hacking skills

## Fundamentals
First of all, how do you hack something you don't understand? After this question is evident, you have to know the fundamentals of IT, but how?

I will suggest this courses to learn the basics of IT:
1. Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (the expensive one)
2. Certificates like CompTIA A+ [[5]](#5-httpswwwcomptiaorgcertificationsa) (medium cost)
3. Courses (the cheapest one) like: -Google IT Support Professional Certificate [[6]](#6-httpswwwcourseraorgprofessional-certificatesgoogle-it-support)

No matter how you learn that, you don't have to gain the "certificate" but knowledge

## Basic Networking Skills
This skill it's like the "backbone" of hacking, you can learn this skill in courses like:
1. Professor Messer Free Network+ Course [[7]](#7-httpsyoutubeas6g6ixcva4)

## Linux Skills

It's no secret that this is one of the most important skills for a hacker, so here are some resources to learn it, although to be honest, I don't recommend you to do a certification, you can learn all this by downloading ubuntu and getting curious.

But if you want a course for the basics, I recommend these resources:

1. NDG Linux Unhatched by Cisco Netacad [[8]](#8-httpswwwnetacadcomcoursesos-itndg-linux-unhatched)

## Programming Skills
If you wanna be a real hacker a modify the programs to your needs, this skill is a must, you will need to learn scripting, and it is advisable to start with python.

1. Python Essentials 1 [[9]](#9-httpsskillsforallcomcoursepython-essentials-1courselangen-us)

## Security Concepts
Learn about the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), the principle of least privilege and all the fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity

1. Professor Messer Free Security+ Course [[10]](#10-httpsyoutube9ne33fpquw8si3cm0m0kabtilpubr)

# Intangible Skills

1. Think Creatively: There is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack. [[13]](#13-httpswwwhackers-arisecompost20160811essentials-skills-of-a-professional-hacker)
2. Problem-Solving Skills: A hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components. This is one of those abilities that comes with many hours of practice. [[13]](#13-httpswwwhackers-arisecompost20160811essentials-skills-of-a-professional-hacker)
3. Persistence: A hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a persistence that you will be able to hack the most secured systems. [[13]](#13-httpswwwhackers-arisecompost20160811essentials-skills-of-a-professional-hacker)
